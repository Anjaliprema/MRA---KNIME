KNIME PROJECT REPORT
Title: [MRA Project Data Visualization Using Cafe Dataset]
Tool Used: KNIME Analytics Platform
Author: [Anjali]

1. Introduction
In this project, I used the KNIME Analytics Platform to perform [briefly describe your project goal, e.g., “data cleaning, preprocessing, and predictive modeling on XYZ dataset.”].
KNIME provides a user-friendly graphical interface that enables building end-to-end data workflows without extensive coding.

2. Objectives
To understand the dataset and preprocess it for analysis.

To design a KNIME workflow for data processing.

To apply data transformation, filtering, and modeling techniques.

To generate insights and visualize the results.

3. Tools & Technologies
KNIME Version: [Specify version, e.g., KNIME 5.2]

Data: [Describe your data source, e.g., CSV file, open dataset]

Nodes Used: File Reader, Data Filter, GroupBy, Joiner, Math Formula, Decision Tree Learner, Scorer, etc.

4. Methodology
Step 1: Data Import
Imported the dataset using the File Reader node.

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values, filtered rows, and normalized data using various transformation nodes.

Step 3: Data Analysis
Applied suitable nodes like GroupBy and Pivoting for summarization.

Step 4: Model Building
Used Learner nodes (e.g., Decision Tree) to build predictive models.

Step 5: Evaluation
Used the Scorer node to evaluate the model performance.

Step 6: Visualization
Visualized results using Bar Chart, Pie Chart, and Scatter Plot nodes.

5. Results
[Summarize key results, e.g., “Achieved 85% model accuracy.”]

[Mention insights discovered from data visualization.]

6. Challenges
Learning node functionalities and configuring workflows.

Handling data type mismatches.

Optimizing workflow efficiency.

7. Conclusion
The KNIME project enhanced my understanding of building data workflows visually. I learned how to handle data end-to-end — from reading raw files to generating analytical models and insights — with minimal coding effort.
